> Write markdown documents with hybrid rendering!

## About the project

This app uses [`ink-mde`](https://github.com/voracious/ink-mde), [`svelte-splitpanes`](https://github.com/orefalo/svelte-splitpanes), and [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) to create a beautiful and highly interactive UI.

There are keyboard shortcuts to do many actions, such as switching view modes (**edit** or **render**), and creating a new document.

Also, there is support for both light and dark modes!

This is how it looks like:
